# Project Setup Guide: DarkAI - Advanced Tool

## Overview

DarkAI - Advanced Tool is a powerful software application designed to streamline various tasks such as data collection from the dark web, training advanced language models, quantum optimization, and more.

## Setup Script

Make it executable using the following command:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x setup.sh
To run the script, simply execute:

bash
Copy code
./setup.sh
#This script will automatically install all necessary dependencies, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the main script. If it doesn't, below is how to set the project up.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
- Internet connection

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the DarkAI repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SilenceGeneric/DarkAI.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
cd DarkAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary libraries and packages needed for the project to run smoothly.

## Step 3: Run the Project

To start using DarkAI - Advanced Tool, run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the user interface of the tool, allowing you to interact with its various features.

## Using the User Interface

Upon running the main script, you'll be presented with the DarkAI - Advanced Tool interface. Here's a brief overview of its functionalities:

1. **Collect and Preprocess Data from Dark Web URL**: Enter a URL to collect data from the dark web and preprocess it for analysis.

2. **Train DarkBERT Model**: Input training data to train the DarkBERT language model for specific tasks.

3. **Select Model for Advanced Search**: Choose between different pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, DarkBERT) for advanced search operations.

4. **Perform Advanced Search**: Enter a query to perform advanced search using the selected model.

5. **Scrape Hacker Forums with Quantum Assistance**: Utilize quantum computing to scrape hacker forums for code snippets using OpenAI Codex.

6. **Integrate Quantum Optimization for Specific Tasks**: Integrate quantum optimization algorithms for solving specific optimization tasks.

7. **Exit**: Close the DarkAI - Advanced Tool interface and exit the program.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to follow on-screen prompts and input requirements while using the tool.
- Consult the project documentation or source code for detailed information on each feature and function.
